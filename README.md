# BabyPlayground

Welcome to BabyPlayground! This repository is a collection of interactive experiments and activities aimed at young children and babies. The initial focus of the project is to create a reactive web page for babies to play with, but the project will be expanded to include other activities and experiments that promote early learning and development.

## Getting Started

To get started with the reactive web page, simply open the `random-page-react.html` file in your web browser. Once the page is open, you can press any key or click anywhere on the page to see the background color change randomly.

## Additional Experiments

As mentioned, the goal of this project is to expand beyond the reactive web page and include other activities and experiments that are designed for young children and babies. Some possible ideas for future experiments include:

* Simple games that promote hand-eye coordination and problem-solving skills
* Interactive stories and picture books that can be read and explored with the help of a caregiver
* Audio and visual stimuli designed to stimulate and engage young children's senses
* Developmental activities and exercises aimed at promoting early learning and cognitive development

## Contributing

If you have an idea for an experiment or activity that would be a good fit for this project, please feel free to contribute! Simply fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. All contributions are welcome and appreciated.
